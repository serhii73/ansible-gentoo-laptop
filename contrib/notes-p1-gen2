 * Messages for package sys-libs/pam-1.4.0_p20200829:

 * Some software with pre-loaded PAM libraries might experience
 * warnings or failures related to missing symbols and/or versions
 * after any update. While unfortunate this is a limit of the
 * implementation of PAM and the software, and it requires you to
 * restart the software manually after the update.
 * 
 * You can get a list of such software running a command like
 *   lsof / | egrep -i 'del.*libpam\.so'
 * 
 * Alternatively, simply reboot your system.
